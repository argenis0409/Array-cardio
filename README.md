# Array Cardio
The name says it all, in this project... I was playing with the array.
Usin JS & HTML.

## Setup
Clone/Download the repo onto your local system then run the following commands:
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

## General Info
Once you run these two commands you should see something like this http://127.0.0.1:8080.
Click on that localhost to open the project in your browser then open your js console.
